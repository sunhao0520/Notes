### English (Unites States, Canada) Spell Check Dictionaries

The en_US and en_CA dictionaries come directly from SCOWL (up to level
60) and is thus under the same copyright of SCOWL.  The affix file is
a heavily modified version of the original english.aff file which was
released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell and as such is covered by
his BSD license.  Part of SCOWL is also based on Ispell thus the
Ispell copyright is included with the SCOWL copyright.

The collective work is Copyright 2000-2011 by Kevin Atkinson as well
as any of the copyrights mentioned below:

	Copyright 2000-2011 by Kevin Atkinson
	
	Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute and sell these word
	lists, the associated scripts, the output created from the scripts,
	and its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee,
	provided that the above copyright notice appears in all copies and
	that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
	supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson makes no representations
	about the suitability of this array for any purpose. It is provided
	"as is" without express or implied warranty.

Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,
in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major
contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of
feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the
Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.

The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to
the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most
common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and
frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist
with Frequency Classification".

The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:

	The Moby lexicon project is complete and has
	been place into the public domain. Use, sell,
	rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.
	
	Placing this material on internal or public servers is
	also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any
	export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.
	
	You can verify the public domain status by contacting
	
	Grady Ward
	3449 Martha Ct.
	Arcata, CA  95521-4884
	
	grady@netcom.com
	grady@northcoast.com

The "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" is also in the
Public Domain:

	Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100
	From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk>
	
	> I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English
	> Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to
	> be lacking any copyright notice.
	
	There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
	"copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
	source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
	PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
	domain.
	
	Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100
	
	> So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?
	
	That is the intention.

The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.

The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at
least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All
words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via
my inflection database.

The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.

The WordNet database, which was used in the creation of the
Inflections database, is under the following copyright:

	This software and database is being provided to you, the LICENSEE,
	by Princeton University under the following license.  By obtaining,

	and/or database.  Title to copyright in this software, database and
	any associated documentation shall at all times remain with

The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0
of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the
public domain.

The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words words appearing
in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts
package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12
dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The
top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a
list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added
myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in
other word lists is included.

The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
don't think can be copyrighted.

The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the
"Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon
File".  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain
a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the
special/ directory.

The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version
4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also
in the public domain.

The 60 level includes all words appearing in at least 2 of the 12
dictionaries as indicated by the 12Dicts package.

The 70 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and the 74,550 common
dictionary words from the MWords package.  The common dictionary words,
like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections
added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of
the 12Dics package which is the public domain.

The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the
ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics
Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words in from YAWL package,
and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.

The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper <thegrendel@theriver.com>,
is in the Public Domain:

	The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released
	into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in
	any manner they see fit. No fee or registration is required for its
	use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you feel you absolutely
	must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of
	the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your
	favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble
	community, as an alternate to "official" word lists. Game designers
	may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please
	mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note
	that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,
	you may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*
	legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
	WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict your
	rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only fair.

UKACD, by J Ross Beresford <ross@bryson.demon.co.uk>, is under the
following copyright:

	Copyright (c) J Ross Beresford 1993-1999. All Rights Reserved.
	
	The following restriction is placed on the use of this publication:
	if The UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary is used in a software package
	or redistributed in any form, the copyright notice must be
	prominently displayed and the text of this document must be included
	verbatim.
	
	There are no other restrictions: I would like to see the list
	distributed as widely as possible.

The 95 level includes the 354,984 single words, 256,772 compound
words, 4,946 female names and the 3,897 male names, and 21,986 names
from the MWords package, ABLE.LST from the ENABLE Supplement, and some
additional words found in my part-of-speech database that were not
found anywhere else.

Accent information was taken from UKACD.

My VARCON package was used to create the American, British, and
Canadian word list. 

Since the original word lists used used in the VARCON package came
from the Ispell distribution they are under the Ispell copyright:

### English (United Kingdom) Spell Check Dictionary

This dictionary was initially based on a subset of the 
original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for 
Pspell and  Aspell and thus is covered by his original 
LGPL licence. 

It has been extensively updated by David Bartlett, Brian Kelk
and Andrew Brown:

- numerous Americanism have been removed
- numerous American spellings have been corrected
- missing words have been added
- many errors have been corrected
- compound hyphenated words have been added where appropriate

Valuable inputs to this process were received from many other 
people - far too numerous to name. Serious thanks to you all
for your greatly appreciated help.

This word list is intended to be a good representation of
current modern British English and thus it should be a good 
basis for Commonwealth English in most countries of the world 
outside North America.

The affix file has been created completely from scratch
by David Bartlett and Andrew Brown, based on the published 
rules for MySpell and is also provided under the LGPL.

In creating the affix rules an attempt has been made to 
reproduce the most general rules for English word
formation, rather than merely use it as a means to
compress the size of the dictionary. It is hoped that this
will facilitate future localisation to other variants of
English.

Please let David Bartlett <dwb@openoffice.org> know of any 
errors that you find.
